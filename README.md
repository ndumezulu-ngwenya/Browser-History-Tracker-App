# Browser-History-Tracker-App
Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a streamlined web browser history tracker employing a linked implementation of stacks for effective management of the user's browsing history. The program aims to provide users with the capability to navigate both backward and forward through their browsing history.

The project involves the development, testing, and implementation of a C++ program, utilising stacks to achieve the specified functionality.  For a simplified web browser history tracker, the typical entry data could be a sequence of user interactions with the browser.
